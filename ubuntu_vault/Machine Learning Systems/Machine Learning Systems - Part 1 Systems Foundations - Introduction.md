# Part 1 Systems Foundations - Introduction

## Purpose:
Why must we master the engineering principles that govern systems capable of learning, adapting and operating at massive scale?
- Machine learning allows systems to behave based on data rather than on explicit instructions => traditional software engineering principles cannot address systems that learn and adapt based on experience 
- ML systems engineering determines our ability to solve complex problems that exceed human cognitive capacity 
### Learning Objectives:
- Define machine learning systems as integrated computing systems comprising data, algorithms, and infrastructure
- Distinguish ML systems engineering from traditional software engineering through failure pattern analysis
- Analyze interdependencies between data, algorithms, and computing infrastructure using the AI Triangle framework
- Trace the historical evolution of AI paradigms from symbolic systems through statistical learning to deep learning 
- Evaluate the implications of Sutton's "Bitter Lesson" for modern ML systems engineering priorities 
- Compare silent performance degradation in ML systems with traditional software failure modern
- Contrast ML system lifecycle phases with traditional software development 
- Classify real-world challenge in ML systems across data, model, system, and ethical categories 
- Apply the five-pillar framework to evaluate ML system architectures
### Self-check: Question 1
1. What is distinguishes machine learning systems from traditional deterministic software architectures?
	a. Machine learning systems operate based on explicitly programmed instructions
	b. Traditional software systems can adapt autonomously to new data
	c. Machine learning systems rely on statistical patterns extracted from data
	d. Traditional software systems require no maintenance
