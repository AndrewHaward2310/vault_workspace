# Part 1 Systems Foundations - Introduction

## Purpose:
Why must we master the engineering principles that govern systems capable of learning, adapting and operating at massive scale?
- Machine learning allows systems to behave based on data rather than on explicit instructions => traditional software engineering principles cannot address systems that learn and adapt based on experience 
- ML systems engineering determines our ability to solve complex problems that exceed human cognitive capacity 
### Learning Objectives:
