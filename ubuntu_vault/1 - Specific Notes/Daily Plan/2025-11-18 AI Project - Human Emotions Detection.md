In this time, I met Mr .Quang  to plan how to fix the circuit for my project, this plan scheduled in yesterday, so the original task was postponed. It is now scheduled for tomorrow afternoon, and I expect  complete it then.
Initially, Mr. Quang helped me solder the circuit according my design, however it failed, the data was not sent to the server. After that, Mr. Quang had a midterm exam for his course, so I used the remaining time to work on 2 new features: 
1. Created a Google Sheet and configured it act as a server 
2. Wrote code to send data to Google Sheet server function
