After eating spicy noodles with my brother - Mr. Viet, we went to Dusk Wings to meet my team and play a game called "The Werewolves of Millers Hollow". 
That night, there were 11 people playing. I don't even remember how many round we played. Around 11 p.m, the moderator went home, so we lost one player and got a new moderator who was more professional according my opinion.
After 4 rounds, 2 people went home, but 2 others from a nearby table joined the game. At 1:30 a.m, we decided to end the game and then had some deep talk time. I chatted with Tung, who studied in the same department as me at University. I shared him a map related to my major.
