In 1971, the percentage of money which the Americans paid for food was highest, which was exactly twice as high as the figure for cars, accounting for 44% and 22% respectively. The proportion of money paid for petrol and furniture were nearly equal, with 10% and 9% respectively, while the figure for restaurants and books were also roughly equal, at 7% and 6% respectively. 2% of spending of people in the UK went on computer, which was lowest. 

After 30 years, the expenditure on food went down dramatically to only 14%, equal to the figure for restaurant. Repeating the same trend, the figures for furniture and petrol was slightly decreased to the same level of 8% each, compared a fall to only 1% in spending on books. In contrast, cars' spending recorded an almost twofold increase to 43% and became highest. Despite a moderate rise, spending on computers and restaurants was still low, at 12% for the former and 14% for the latter.
