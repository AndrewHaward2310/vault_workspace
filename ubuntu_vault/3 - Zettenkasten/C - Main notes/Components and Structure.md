# Components and Structure
- ES are specialized computing systems designed to perform specific functions within larger systems.
- it consists of various hardware and software components carefully integrated to achieve their intended task efficiently and reliably.
# Hardware components:
## 1. Important Components of Hardware:
### a. Microcontroller or Microprocessor: 
- At the heart of every ES, responsible for executing for program instructions and controlling system operations.
- Microcontrollers: 
	- they are integrated circuits containing a CPU, memory, input/output peripherals, and other essential components on a single chip 
	=> suitable for embedded applications requiring compactness and low power consumption
- Microprocessors:
	- They are general-purpose CPUs used in more complex embedded systems with higher computational requirements
### b. Memory:
- ES utilize various types of memory to store program code, data, and system configurations:
	- Read-Only Memory (ROM): storing firmware or boot code
	- Random-Access Memory: runtime data storage
	- Non-Volatile Memory or Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory (EEPROM): storing persistent data that survives power cycles
### c. Peripherals:
- they are external devices or components connected to microcontroller or microprocessor to enable input, output, and communication with the external world
# 2. Parts of Software Components:
- Editor
- Emulator 
- Assembler
- Compiler
- Linker 
- Debugger
