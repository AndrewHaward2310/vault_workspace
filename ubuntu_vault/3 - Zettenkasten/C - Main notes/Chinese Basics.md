# Chinese Basics
- Chinese or Hànyǔ (汉语) is the native language of the Han nationality of China
- As the Han people constitute more than 90% of the population of China, native speakers of Chinese form the largest speech community in the world
- Chinese has different dialects. In this course, it refers to Mandarin or Pǔtōnghuà (普通话, ‘common speech’)
- Chinese uses characters. The pronunciation of a character includes a syllable and a tone 
	- Tone is the use of pitch to distinguish lexical or grammatical meanings
	- it has 4 tones in Chinese, but some characters do not have tones
	- Pinyin is used to represent the pronunciation of each character
	- The alphabet for pinyin consists of 26 English letters, among them the letter V is only used to spell foreign names and the other 
	- A syllable contains an initial and a final. The initial is the beginning consonant of a syllable, whereas the final is the simple or compound vowel of a syllable 
	- For example: “**好**” is pronounced **hǎo** with **h** being the initial and **ɑo** being the final. The mark (**ˇ**) over **a** in **ao** is the tone

	- The most important function of the tone is to differentiate meanings represented by the characters, so different tones will lead to different characters with different meanings
