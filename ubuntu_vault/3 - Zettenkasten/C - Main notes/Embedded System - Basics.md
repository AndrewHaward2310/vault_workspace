# Embedded System - Basics

# 1. Introduction to Embedded systems using C
- Embedded systems are pervasive in our model world
- Embedded systems are specialized computers designed to perform dedicated functions within larger systems
- One of the most popular programming languages for embedded systems development is C, renowned for its efficiency, versatility, and close relationship with hardware
# 2. Understanding Embedded Systems
- focus on specific functions, often in real-time environments with resource limitations such as memory, processing power, and energy consumption
- Classified into 2 categories
	- Standalone: independently, executing predefined tasks without external communication
	- networked/embedded systems: connect to other devices or networks to exchange data, enabling functionalities like remote monitoring and control
# 3. The role of C in Embedding Systems
- C is widely preferred for ES Development due to: its efficiency, low-level access to hardware, and extensive toolchain support
- its syntax allows for precise control over memory and hardware resources, critical for embedded applications where resource utilization is paramount
- optimize code for performance and size with C's close-to-the-hardware nature, crucial in resource-constrained environments
