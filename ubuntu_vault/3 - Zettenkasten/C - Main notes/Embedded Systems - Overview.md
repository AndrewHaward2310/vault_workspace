# Embedded Systems - Overview

# 1. What is embedded system? 
- refers to something that is joined to another entity
- An embedded system can function as a standalone unit or as a component of a larger system
- a microcontroller or microprocessor based system that is intended to carry out a certain function is called an embedded system
- An embedded system consists of 3 parts:
	- Hardware is present
	- Application are available for it 
	- It has a Real Time Operating System (RTOS) that manages the application software and offers a way to schedule and allow the processor to execute a process by adhering to a latency control plan 
- Features:
	- Single-functioned: An Embedded system typically carries out a single, specialized task once. As an illustration, a pager always does its job as a pager 
	- Tiny confined:
		- Design metrics are subject to restrictions in all computing systems, but embedded systems may have very strict restrictions.
		- Design metrics quantify the attributes of an implementation, including its price, size, power, and effectiveness.
		- It needs to be small enough to fit on a single chip, operate quickly enough to process data instantly, and use as little power as possible to prolong battery life.
	- Reactive and real-time:
		- A lot of embedded systems have to compute specific outcomes instantly in real-time and constantly respond to changes in their surroundings
		- Take a look at an automobile cruise control unit example
- Advantages:
	- Simple to Tailor
	- Minimal power use 
	- Low Price
	- Improved output
