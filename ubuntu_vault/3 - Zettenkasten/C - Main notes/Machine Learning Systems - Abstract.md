# Machine Learning Systems - Abstract
## Principles and Practices of Engineering Artificially Intelligent Systems

- Machine Learning Systems provides a systematic framework for understanding and engineering Machine Learning Systems. 
- The textbook bridges the gap between theoretical foundation and practical engineering, emphasizing the systems perspective required to build effective AI solutions
- Unlike resources that focus primarily on algorithms and model architectures, this book highlights the broader context in which ML systems operate, including data engineering, model optimization, hardware-aware training, and inference acceleration
- Readers will develop the ability to reason about ML system architectures and apply enduring engineering principles for building flexible, efficient, and robust machine learning systems.

- The learning journey unfolds in five distinct phases:
	- **Phase 1: Theory** - Build your conceptual foundation through **Foundations** and **Design Principles**, establishing the mental models that underpin all effective systems work.
	- **Phase 2: Performance** - Master **Performance Engineering** to transform theoretical understanding into systems that run efficiently in resource-constrained real-world environments.
	- **Phase 3: Practice** - Navigate Robust Deployment challenges, learning how to make
