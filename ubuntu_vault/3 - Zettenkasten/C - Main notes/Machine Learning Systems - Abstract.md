# Machine Learning Systems - Abstract
## Principles and Practices of Engineering Artificially Intelligent Systems

- Machine Learning Systems provides a systematic framework for understanding and engineering Machine Learning Systems. 
- The textbook bridges the gap between theoretical foundation and practical engineering, emphasizing the systems perspective required to build effective AI solutions
- Unlike resources that focus primarily on algorithms and model architectures, this book highlights the broader context in which ML systems operate, including data engineering, model optimization, hardware-aware training, and inference acceleration
- Readers will develop the ability to reason about ML system architectures and apply enduring engineering principles for building flexible, efficient, and robust machine learning systems.

	— African Proverb
- The learning journey unfolds in five distinct phases:
	- **Phase 1: Theory** - Build your conceptual foundation through **Foundations** and **Design Principles**, establishing the mental models that underpin all effective systems work.
	- **Phase 2: Performance** - Master **Performance Engineering** to transform theoretical understanding into systems that run efficiently in resource-constrained real-world environments.
	- **Phase 3: Practice** - Navigate Robust Deployment challenges, learning how to make systems work reliably beyond the controlled environment of development.
	- **Phase 4: Ethics** - Explore **Trustworthy Systems** to ensure your systems serve society beneficially and sustainably
	- **Phase 5: Vision** - Look toward **ML Systems Frontiers** to understand emerging paradigms and prepare for the next generation of challenges
- The curriculum emphasizes mastery of these core building blocks:
	- The interaction between models and hardware 
	- Data flow patterns through systems 
	- Computational pattern emergence 
	- Optimization principles within individual systems
- **Key learning outcomes:** 6 levels of learning, ranging from foundational knowledge to advanced creative thinking:

	1. **Remembering:** Recall basic facts and concepts 
	2. **Understanding:** Explaining ideas or processes 
	3. **Applying:** Using knowledge in new situations
	4. **Analyzing:** Breaking down information into components
	5. **Evaluating:** Making judgements based on criteria and standards 
	6. **Creating:** Producing original work or solutions
- Learning Objectives:
	1. Systems thinking: Understanding how ML systems differ from traditional software, and reason about hardware-software interactions
	2. Workflow Engineering: Design end-to-end ML pipelines, from data engineering through deployment and maintenance 
	3. Performance Optimization: Apply systematic approaches to make systems faster, smaller, and more resource-efficient
	4. Production Deployment: Address real-world challenges including reliability, security, privacy, and scalability
	5. Responsible Development: Navigate ethical implications and implement sustainable, sociably beneficial AI systems.
	6. Future-Ready Skills: Develop judgment to evaluate emerging technologies and adapt to evolving paradigms
	7. Hands-On Implementation: Gain practical experience across diverse embedded platforms
