# Machine Learning Systems - Abstract
## Principles and Practices of Engineering Artificially Intelligent Systems

- Machine Learning Systems provides a systematic framework for understanding and engineering Machine Learning Systems. 
- The textbook bridges the gap between theoretical foundation and practical engineering, emphasizing the systems perspective required to build effective AI solutions
- Unlike resources that focus primarily on algorithms and model architectures, this book highlights the broader context in which ML systems operate, including data engineering, model optimization, hardware-aware training, and inference acceleration
- Readers will develop the ability to reason about ML system architectures and apply enduring engineering principles for building flexible, efficient, and robust machine learning systems.
