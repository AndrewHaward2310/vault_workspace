Certain individuals contend that good health is core human prerequisite, and as such, medical services should not be controlled by profit-driven corporations. This answer will elaborate on both upsides and downsides of privatized healthcare, it is my belief that this healthcare systems offers more drawbacks.

Certain individuals contend that superiors shouldn't prioritize the dressing style of their employees, as their performance at work is what matters. 
Alternative ways to paraphrase:
- Some argue that employers should focus entirely on job performance rather than their staff's attire.
- It is argue by some that an employee's clothing choices should be irrelevant to management, provided the quality of their work is high.
- There is a widespread belief that workplace attire should not be a concern for employers, since a worker's actual output is the only thing of true importance.
This essay will delve into this discourse, exploring the merits of each perspective and ultimately presenting a balanced view on the matter. 
I advocate a strict dress code, believing that it contributes significantly to a professional and cohesive workplace atmosphere.
