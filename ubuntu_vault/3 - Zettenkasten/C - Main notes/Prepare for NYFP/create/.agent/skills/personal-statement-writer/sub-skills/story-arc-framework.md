### Act-by-Act Guide

| Act                   | Purpose           | Questions to Answer                     |
| --------------------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **1. Setup**          | Ground the reader | Where did your journey begin?           |
| **2. Rising Action**  | Build interest    | What experiences shaped you?            |
| **3. Climax**         | The turning point | What moment changed everything?         |
| **4. Falling Action** | Show growth       | What did you learn? How did you change? |
| **5. Resolution**     | Future vision     | Where are you going? Why this program?  |

### Narrative Techniques

**Show, Don't Tell**
```
❌ "I am passionate about AI."
✅ "At 2 AM, debugging a reinforcement learning agent that kept 
   crashing into warehouse walls, I realized I wasn't frustrated — 
   I was fascinated."
```

**Specific Details > Vague Claims**
```
❌ "I gained valuable experience during my internship."
✅ "During my 6-month internship at VinAI, I reduced inference 
   latency from 200ms to 45ms by implementing model quantization."
```

**Connect Past to Future**
```
❌ "I want to study AI because it's the future."
✅ "My experience deploying robots in Vietnamese warehouses revealed 
   that current multi-agent systems fail in exactly the scenarios 
   my research addresses."
```

### The Emotional Arc
Every strong personal statement has an emotional dimension:
1. **Curiosity** — what made you wonder?
2. **Challenge** — what was hard?
3. **Discovery** — what did you learn?
4. **Purpose** — what drives you forward?
