sparked your passion. DO NOT start with "I have always been 
interested in..." — show, don't tell.

robots navigate around each other with near-misses, I realized that 
the gap between academic algorithms and industrial reality was wider 
than any research paper had prepared me for."

PARAGRAPH 2: YOUR BACKGROUND (3-4 sentences)
─────────────────────────────────────────────
Connect your education and key experiences to your field. 
Highlight 1-2 defining achievements with specific details.

PARAGRAPH 3: THE CHALLENGE / TURNING POINT (3-4 sentences)
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Describe a challenge that shaped your perspective. What did you 
learn? How did it change your direction?

PARAGRAPH 4: WHY THIS PROGRAM (3-4 sentences)
