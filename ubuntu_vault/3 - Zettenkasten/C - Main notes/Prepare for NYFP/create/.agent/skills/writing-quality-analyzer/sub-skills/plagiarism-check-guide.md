### Types of Plagiarism

| Type                 | Description                           | How to Avoid                             |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Direct Copy**      | Word-for-word copying                 | Always paraphrase or quote with citation |
| **Mosaic/Patchwork** | Mixing others' phrases into your text | Rewrite in your own words entirely       |
| **Self-Plagiarism**  | Reusing your own published work       | Cite your previous work                  |
| **Idea Plagiarism**  | Using someone's idea without credit   | Cite the original source                 |
| **Accidental**       | Forgetting to cite or misquoting      | Double-check all references              |

### Paraphrasing Rules
1. **Read the original** — understand the core idea
2. **Look away** — write from memory in your own words
3. **Compare** — ensure no phrases match (3+ consecutive words)
4. **Cite** — always attribute the idea even when paraphrased

### Self-Check Process
1. Run through a plagiarism checker (Turnitin, iThenticate, Grammarly)
2. Check for any similarity scores > 15% (excluding references)
3. Verify all direct quotes are in quotation marks with page numbers
4. Ensure all paraphrased ideas have proper citations
5. Check that your reference list matches in-text citations
