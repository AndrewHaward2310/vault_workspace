| #   | Error                           | Example                                                   | Fix                                        |
| --- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| 1   | **Subject-verb disagreement**   | "The data shows"                                          | "The data show" (data is plural)           |
| 2   | **Dangling modifier**           | "Using the algorithm, results improved"                   | "Using the algorithm, we improved results" |
| 3   | **Run-on sentences**            | Two independent clauses joined without proper punctuation | Split or use semicolons                    |
| 4   | **Comma splice**                | "The model converged, it achieved 95% accuracy"           | "...converged; it achieved..."             |
| 5   | **Misplaced "which" vs "that"** | Restrictive vs non-restrictive                            | "that" restricts; "which" adds info        |
| 6   | **Tense inconsistency**         | Mixing past and present in one paragraph                  | Stick to one tense per section             |
| 7   | **Missing articles**            | "We used algorithm"                                       | "We used the/an algorithm"                 |
| 8   | **"It" without antecedent**     | "It was found that..."                                    | "The analysis revealed that..."            |
| 9   | **Nominalization overuse**      | "The utilization of the method"                           | "Using the method"                         |
| 10  | **Unclear pronoun reference**   | "They showed improvement"                                 | "The models showed improvement"            |
