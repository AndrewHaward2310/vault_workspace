### Academic Writing Conventions
1. **Third person preferred**: "This study demonstrates..." not "I think..."
2. **Hedging language**: "The results suggest..." not "The results prove..."
3. **Passive voice (selective)**: OK in methods — "Data were collected..."
4. **No contractions**: "do not" not "don't"; "it is" not "it's"
5. **No rhetorical questions**: Make statements instead
6. **Define terms on first use**: "Reinforcement Learning (RL)"

### Hedging Phrases (For Nuanced Claims)
```
Strong claim:  "This proves that..."
Hedged claim:  "These findings suggest that..."
               "The evidence indicates that..."
               "It appears that..."
               "This may be attributed to..."
```

### Tone Verification Questions
- [ ] Are all contractions expanded?
- [ ] Is the vocabulary appropriately formal?
- [ ] Are claims properly hedged (not overstated)?
