# Paper Structure Guide (IMRaD)

## The Universal Structure for Scientific Papers

### IMRaD Framework
Most scientific papers follow the **IMRaD** structure:

| Section          | Purpose              | Typical Length |
| ---------------- | -------------------- | -------------- |
| **Introduction** | Why did you do this? | 15-20%         |
| **Methods**      | How did you do it?   | 20-25%         |
| **Results**      | What did you find?   | 25-30%         |
| **Discussion**   | What does it mean?   | 25-30%         |

### Section Writing Tips

#### Introduction Pattern
1. **Broad Context**: Start wide — the field, the importance
2. **Narrow Down**: Focus on the specific problem
3. **Gap**: What hasn't been solved?
4. **Your Contribution**: What this paper does
5. **Paper Outline**: Brief roadmap (optional)

#### Results Writing Rules
- Present results **objectively** — save interpretation for Discussion
- Always reference tables/figures: "As shown in Table 1..."
- Highlight key findings, don't just dump data
- Use consistent significant figures

#### Discussion Pattern
1. **Summarize key findings** (1-2 sentences)
2. **Interpret results** in context of literature
3. **Compare with prior work** — better/worse and why
4. **Acknowledge limitations** honestly
5. **Suggest future directions**
