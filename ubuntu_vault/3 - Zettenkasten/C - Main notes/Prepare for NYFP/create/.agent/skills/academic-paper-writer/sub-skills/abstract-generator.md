## How to Write an Effective Abstract

### The 4-Sentence Abstract Formula

1. **Context** (1-2 sentences): What is the problem and why does it matter?
2. **Approach** (1-2 sentences): What did you do to solve it?
3. **Results** (1-2 sentences): What did you find?
4. **Significance** (1 sentence): Why does this matter?

### Template

```
[FIELD/PROBLEM] is critical for [REASON]. However, existing approaches 
suffer from [LIMITATION]. In this paper, we propose [METHOD NAME], 
a [BRIEF DESCRIPTION] that [KEY INNOVATION]. We evaluate our approach 
on [DATASET/BENCHMARK] and demonstrate that [KEY RESULT], achieving 
[METRIC] improvement over [BASELINE]. Our results suggest that 
[BROADER IMPLICATION].
```

### Abstract Checklist
- [ ] States the problem clearly
- [ ] Describes the approach concisely
- [ ] Reports key quantitative results
- [ ] Stays within word limit (typically 150-300 words)
- [ ] No citations in abstract
- [ ] No undefined abbreviations
- [ ] Self-contained (readable without the paper)
- [ ] Written in past tense (methods/results) and present tense (significance)

### Common Mistakes
- ❌ Too vague: "We propose a novel method that outperforms existing approaches."
- ✅ Specific: "We propose GNN-IL-PPO, a graph neural network framework that achieves 94.2% task completion rate, outperforming greedy baselines by 18.7%."
