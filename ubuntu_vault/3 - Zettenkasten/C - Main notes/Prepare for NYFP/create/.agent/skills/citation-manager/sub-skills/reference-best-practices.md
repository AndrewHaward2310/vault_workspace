# Reference Best Practices

## Citation Integrity Rules

### The Golden Rules
1. **Every claim needs a source** — unsupported claims are opinions
2. **Primary sources preferred** — cite the original, not someone citing it
3. **Recent sources matter** — include papers from the last 3-5 years
4. **Balance is key** — don't over-cite one author or one lab
5. **Self-citations proportionate** — max 10-15% of references

### Common Citation Mistakes

| Mistake                                       | Fix                              |
| --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Citing a review instead of the original paper | Find and cite the primary source |
| "Many studies show..." without refs           | Add specific citations           |
| Citing retracted papers                       | Check Retraction Watch database  |
| Outdated references only                      | Add recent work (2020+)          |
| Missing DOIs                                  | Look up DOIs on CrossRef         |
| Inconsistent format (mixing IEEE & APA)       | Pick ONE format and stick to it  |

### Reference Count Guidelines

| Paper Type             | Typical References |
| ---------------------- | ------------------ |
| Conference (4-6 pages) | 15-30              |
| Journal article        | 30-60              |
| Review article         | 80-150+            |
| Thesis chapter         | 30-50 per chapter  |
