### Tips for Scholarship Letters
1. **Reference the mission** — show alignment with their values
2. **Be specific about plans** — vague goals = weak application
3. **Mention country/community impact** — especially for international fellowships
4. **Include academic credentials** — but don't repeat the CV entirely
5. **Formal but warm tone** — professional yet personable
