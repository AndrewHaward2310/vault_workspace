# ATS Optimizer Guide

## Making Your Resume Pass Automated Screening

### What is ATS?
Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) scan and rank resumes before humans see them. 75%+ of large companies use ATS. If your resume isn't ATS-friendly, it won't reach a human.

### ATS-Safe Formatting
| Do ✅                            | Don't ❌                 |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Standard section headers        | Creative header names   |
| Simple bullet points (•)        | Custom bullets (★, →)   |
| Standard fonts (Arial, Calibri) | Decorative fonts        |
| Single-column layout            | Multi-column layouts    |
| Text-based content              | Images, icons, charts   |
| .docx or .pdf format            | .pages, image-based PDF |
| Standard date format (Mon Year) | Unclear date formats    |

### Keyword Optimization Strategy
1. **Read the job posting carefully** — extract key terms
2. **Mirror exact language** — "machine learning" not "ML" (include both)
3. **Include hard skills** from the requirements section
4. **Match job title** — use their terminology, not your creative version
5. **Include tools by name** — "PyTorch" not "deep learning framework"

### ATS Compatibility Scoring Checklist
- [ ] Does the resume use standard section headers?
- [ ] Are keywords from the job posting present?
- [ ] Is the format simple (no tables, columns, graphics)?
- [ ] Are dates in a standard format?
- [ ] Is contact information at the top?
- [ ] Are job titles clearly stated?
- [ ] Is the file format correct (.docx or .pdf)?
