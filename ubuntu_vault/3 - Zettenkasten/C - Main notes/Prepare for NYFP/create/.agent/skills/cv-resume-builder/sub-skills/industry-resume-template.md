### ATS-Optimized Tips
1. **No graphics, icons, or images** — ATS can't parse them
2. **Standard section headers** — "Experience" not "Where I've Been"
3. **Keywords from job posting** — mirror exact terms used
4. **Quantify everything** — numbers prove impact
5. **One page maximum** — unless 10+ years of directly relevant experience
6. **PDF or DOCX** format as requested
7. **Simple fonts**: Arial, Calibri, Times New Roman (10-12pt)
