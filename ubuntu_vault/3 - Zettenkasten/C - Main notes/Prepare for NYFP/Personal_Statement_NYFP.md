In January 2024, I stood on the factory floor during the DENSO Factory Hacks — a collaboration between FPT and DENSO — and witnessed something that would reshape my understanding of technology's role in manufacturing. While our team was developing an AI-powered error detection system, I noticed production line workers manually scanning through pages of printed error logs, trying to correlate machine faults with historical patterns. They possessed decades of intuitive expertise, yet lacked tools to leverage it systematically. In that moment, I realized that the AI revolution in manufacturing was not a technology problem — it was a bridge-building problem.

## The Digital Transformation Gap in Southeast Asian Manufacturing

Southeast Asia is one of the world's fastest-growing manufacturing regions, with Vietnam alone contributing approximately 25% of its GDP from industrial production. Yet a striking paradox persists: while advanced AI systems can now autonomously coordinate fleets of robots and predict equipment failures before they occur, the vast majority of factories in the region still rely on manual processes, paper-based documentation, and reactive maintenance strategies.

This gap is not merely technical. It is systemic. It encompasses a shortage of engineers who can translate cutting-edge AI research into practical industrial applications, a lack of locally adapted solutions, and a cultural disconnect between the academic research community and industry practitioners. Having grown up in Vietnam and studied mechatronics engineering at Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST), I have experienced this disconnect firsthand — not as an abstract concept, but as a daily reality.

## My Journey: From Classical Control to Intelligent Systems

My academic journey has been shaped by a consistent thread: applying emerging technologies to solve tangible industrial problems.

It began in 2022 when I developed a warehouse management system using Ultra-Wideband (UWB) technology, building real-time indoor positioning capabilities for asset tracking. This project earned HUST's Innovation and Scientific Research Award and introduced me to the challenges of integrating hardware sensors with cloud-based data architectures.

The turning point came during the DENSO Factory Hacks in 2023, where I led a team to create an LLM-based industrial error alert system. By combining Elasticsearch for data indexing with Weaviate's vector database for semantic search, we enabled factory operators to query historical error patterns using natural language — transforming how workers interacted with machine data. Our system earned Third Prize, but more importantly, it exposed me to the enormous potential of AI in manufacturing and the equally enormous barriers to its adoption.

This experience directly motivated my most ambitious project to date: developing a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for autonomous guided vehicle (AGV) coordination in smart factory environments (2025). Using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) combined with Graph Neural Networks, I designed a system where multiple autonomous vehicles could learn cooperative behaviors — task allocation, collision avoidance, and deadlock resolution — through training rather than explicit programming. Integrating PID-based control with RL agents allowed me to bridge classical control theory with modern AI, demonstrating that these approaches are complementary, not competing.

## Why This Matters: A Vision for Human-AI Collaborative Manufacturing

The projects I have undertaken share a common philosophy: AI should empower human workers, not replace them. The factory operators I met at DENSO were not obstacles to automation — they were domain experts whose knowledge, if properly captured and augmented by AI systems, could accelerate the digital transformation of entire industries.

I believe the future of Industry 4.0 in developing economies lies in building intelligent systems that:

1. **Augment human decision-making** through natural language interfaces and explainable AI, rather than black-box automation
2. **Adapt to local constraints** — including limited infrastructure, varying levels of digital literacy, and the need for incremental rather than disruptive deployment
3. **Bridge the research-to-practice gap** through engineers who understand both the theoretical foundations of AI and the practical realities of factory floors

## Why NUS Young Fellowship Programme

The NUS Young Fellowship Programme, with its focus on "AI and Graduate Research," represents a unique opportunity to advance this vision. NUS's College of Design and Engineering houses world-leading research groups in robotics, intelligent systems, and smart manufacturing — areas that directly align with my research trajectory. Singapore itself serves as a living laboratory for Industry 4.0, with its Advanced Manufacturing initiatives providing a model that Southeast Asian nations can learn from and adapt.

I am eager to engage with NUS faculty whose work spans the intersection of AI and engineering systems, to learn from peers representing diverse global perspectives, and to explore how my cross-disciplinary background in mechatronics, reinforcement learning, and industrial IoT can contribute to addressing one of the most pressing challenges facing manufacturing economies worldwide.

Through the programme, I hope not only to deepen my research capabilities but also to build the international network and academic foundation necessary to pursue graduate studies that will enable me to become the bridge-builder that Southeast Asia's industrial transformation urgently needs.
