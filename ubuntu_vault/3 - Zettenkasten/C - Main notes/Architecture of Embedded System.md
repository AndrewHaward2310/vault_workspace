# 1. MCU vs MPU:
![[Pasted image 20260115153258.png]]
- MPU - Microprocessor - it enables in an IC, that is integrated chip, in which we have a central processing unit, a cache memory, a DRAM, and a hard drive 
	- The central processing unit (CPU) of a computer was combined onto a single integrated circuit with invention of the microprocessor, which initially appeared in the late 1960s and early 1970s
	- a CPU of computer combined single integrated chip
	- a microcontroller allowed for a dense placement of transistors in a smaller area 
	- computers and calculators were among the first items to use microprocessors
	- Small Scale Integration (SSI), IC devices with a few hundred transistors were used instead of discrete parts made up the CPU's control processing units in the computer 
- MCU - Microcontroller - it has multiple IC, so it verifies from one IC to another IC.
	- It is a single integrated circuit (IC) with a programmable unit/output interface, memory (Programmable ROM, RAM) and a CPU core
	- The microcontroller is refers to as an MCU, or uC for short
	- Based on their data bit width MCU divided into 3 parts, that is 32 bit, 16 bit, and 8 bit.
