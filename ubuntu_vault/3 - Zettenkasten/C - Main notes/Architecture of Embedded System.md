- MPU - Microprocessor - it enables in an IC, that is integrated chip, in which we have a central processing unit, a cache memory, a DRAM, and a hard drive 
- MCU - Microcontroller - it has multiple IC, so it verifies from one IC to another IC.
	- It is a single integrated circuit (IC) with a programmable unit/output interface, memory (Programmable ROM, RAM) and a CPU core
	- The microcontroller is refers to as an MCU, or uC for short
	- Based on their data
